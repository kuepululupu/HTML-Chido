An introduction to SonarQube
How you can evaluate a coder? You can evaluate a coder for the lines of code are generated in quality not
in quantity.
Because measuring the quality in lines of code are very hard.

1.1 WHY SonarQube!?
SonarQube is a free and open source “code quality platform.” It gives you a
moment-in-time snapshot of your code quality today

as well as trending of lagging(what’s already gone wrong) and leading (what’s likely to go wrong in the future)
quality indicators.

SonarQube doesn’t just show you what’s wrong. It also offers quality-management
tools to actively help you put it right. That’s because software quality is something every system stakeholder cares about, not just end users.

1.1.1 Proven Tecnologies
If SonarQube uses existing tools. Why not just run those tools alone? There is a lots of reasons.
The first is that the tools generate laundry lists of potential problems, don’t generate metrics, and, for the most part, they don’t offer tracking or trending from analysis to analysis
SonarQube can be used to apply standardized rule sets, also offers its own rules and measurement algorithms.
